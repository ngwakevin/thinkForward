# Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) defines and provisions infrastructure through declarative or imperative code instead of manual console actions.

## Benefits
- Reproducibility & drift reduction
- Version control & audit trail
- Reviewable / testable changes
- Faster environment cloning

## Core Concepts
| Concept | Summary |
| ------- | ------- |
| Declarative | Describe end state (Terraform, Bicep) |
| Imperative | Step by step (scripts, SDK) |
| Idempotency | Safe re-apply without side effects |
| State | Source of truth for deployed resources |
| Modules | Reusable abstractions for patterns |

## Lifecycle
1. Author / update definitions
2. Plan (preview changes)
3. Apply (create/update/delete)
4. Validate (tests / policies)
5. Monitor & drift detect

## Good Practices
- Minimal manual console edits
- Separate state backends per environment
- Explicit versions for providers/modules
- Tagging strategy (owner, env, cost center)
- Policy as code (guardrails)

## Pitfalls
- Storing secrets in plain text
- Over-abstracting early
- Large unreviewed plans
- Mixing imperative tweaks with declarative base

> Start with a small module (network + compute) and iterate.
