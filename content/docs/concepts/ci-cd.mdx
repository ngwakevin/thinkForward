# CI/CD Fundamentals

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures every change integrates cleanly. Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD) moves integrated changes to environments quickly and safely.

## Objectives
- Reduce integration risk
- Shorten feedback loops
- Increase deploy confidence & frequency

## Core Stages
1. **Source** – Code + config + infrastructure definitions
2. **Build** – Compile / package / containerize
3. **Test** – Unit, integration, security, smoke
4. **Artifact** – Immutable image or package
5. **Deploy** – Push to target environment
6. **Verify** – Health checks, synthetic tests, metrics

## Key Practices
| Practice | Why |
| -------- | --- |
| Small commits | Easier isolate failures |
| Automated tests | Fast safety net |
| Immutable artifacts | Promote same build across envs |
| Trunk-based dev | Reduces merge drift |
| Shift-left security | Catch issues early |

## Metrics
- Lead time for change
- Deployment frequency
- Change failure rate
- MTTR (Mean time to restore)

## Anti‑Patterns
- Long‑lived feature branches
- Manual test gate without automation
- Rebuilding artifact per environment
- Hidden deployment scripts

> Start simple: one trunk, one pipeline, one artifact, visible metrics.
