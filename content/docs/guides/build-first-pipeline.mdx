# Build Your First Pipeline

Goal: validate every push builds & tests in under 5 minutes.

## Prereqs
- Git repo with a small app
- Basic test command

## Steps
1. Add workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
2. Install dependencies
3. Run tests
4. Cache dependencies for speed
5. Surface status badge

## Example (GitHub Actions)
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: npm
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test --if-present
```

## Extend
- Add lint + type check
- Add security scan (e.g. Trivy, CodeQL)
- Add artifact packaging

## Success Criteria
- Green build on main
- Failing tests block merges
- Duration < 5m

> Ship the simple pipeline first; optimize after reliability.
